### CTF Branding

2019 - 2020

I was deeply involved in CTF for 2 years and one of my many tasks for the club was branding. I worked on user interface design, posters, and merchandise.

### About the work

CTF has its own site to maintain as well as many others for different student assoications. Since the websites are for students, I helped create cute animations that add to the experience. 

The organisation owns and operates 3 computer labs as well as some study spaces therefore posters are necessary to inform students about the space. These are meant to be bold and simple since most students are in a rush to print or preoccupied with studying. 

Finally, I designed sweatshirts for all 50 of CTF's members.
