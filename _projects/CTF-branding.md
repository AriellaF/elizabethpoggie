### CTF

2019 - 2020

For 2 years I ran elections for approximately 30 different student groups at McGill. I Solved responsive design issues for other clubs and developed the CTF main website. As well, I increased student involvement in development by hosting tutorials and dev nights. Below you can see some of the work I contributed.

[Visit the main page that I developed here](https://ctf.science.mcgill.ca/)

### About the work

CTF has its own site to maintain as well as many others for different student associations. Since the websites are for students, I helped create cute animations that add to the experience. 

The organisation owns and operates 3 computer labs as well as some study spaces therefore posters are necessary to inform students about the space. These are meant to be bold and simple since most students are in a rush to print or preoccupied with studying. 

Finally, I designed sweatshirts for all 50 of CTF's members.
