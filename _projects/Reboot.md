Reboot McGill takes, repairs, and redistributes old computers at McGill and I was paid to make sweatshirt designs that best represent the clubâ€™s hip yet technical vibe.  They are being printed onto the sleaves of the sweatshirts and given to all 30 members of the club in the upcoming academic year. (assuming we can be on campus)
