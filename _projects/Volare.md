This is the Classicâ€™s Creative Journal and I have also done their cover for 2 years now. The audience for this group is all the creative writers of McGill. The play that was being focused on was the Bacchae so I tried to keep the mood of the cover elegant for the journal, while still maintaining the chaotic and violent nature of the play.
