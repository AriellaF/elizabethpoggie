### Pat-a-Cat

2019

This is a game developed for McHacks where you pat cats. In this game you can compete against your friends to pat cats, as many cats as you can using keyboard controls. This is designed to help you relax to some lofi hip hop beats and pat some cats to break from the stress of everyday life. Once a cat is patted, you get to listen to the happy meows of hackers, sponsors, and coordinators of McHacks. Each cat you pat is a member of the team that made it happen.

### The Team

### Prize

We won best design :)

<br>

### Inspiration 

Pat-a-cat was inspired when Aidon Lebar said "all i want to do is pet cats" and from there started a story of heroism as David Lougheed made it happen. In the corners of McHacks you could witness the cats being drawn, meows being recorded, and code being coded.

### My Contribution

I made the fonts, graphic art, and contributed to gathering the meows from the particpants. Not much coding on my end but was here to optimize aesthetics. In the end we won best design so I am proud to have done my job :)

### Accomplishments

We are proud of CTF (McGill Computer Taskforce) united together as one to create a project we are proud of. As well, we are are also so thrilled to have to the chance to talk to 100 different people, make a working final product, and put our skills to the test to create something fantastic.
