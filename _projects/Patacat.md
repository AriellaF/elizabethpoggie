You pat cats. In this game you can compete against your friends to pat cats, as many cats as you can using keyboard controls. This is designed to help you relax to some lofi hip hop beats and pat some cats to break from the stress of everyday life. Once a cat is patted, you get to listen to the happy meows of hackers, sponsors, and coordinators of McHacks. Each cat you pat is a member of the team that made it happen. 

The controls are WASD to move Player 1, E to pat with Player 1 and IJKL to move Player 2, O to pat with Player 2.
